# 24 CSS Projects Challenge

Welcome to my  **24 CSS Projects**  repository, where I follow the **[freeCodeCamp 24 CSS Projects Challenge](https://youtu.be/TzuWIHGFKCQ?si=mv9ml4A5ABHIxl07)**. This repo is a visual playground of fundamental to intermediate CSS concepts — brought to life through 24 mini projects.

> Each project is built using only **HTML** and **CSS** - no JavaScript! (except for [Github Contributions Graph](./24-github-contributions-graph/))
